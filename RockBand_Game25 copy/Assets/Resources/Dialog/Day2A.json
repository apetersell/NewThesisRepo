Like, as a group!\n    <<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n    <<expression J-Pe Neutral>>\n    *sigh*\n    Listen, a new group like us, we have to launch ourselves slowly. It's easier just to have one face out there, for now.\n->Yeah?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig Angry>>\n    Yeah, so what?\n    <<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n    <<expression J-Pe Angry>>\n    <<statDown Friendship J-Pe>>\n    Ugh!

Trust me! Teamwork makes the dream work!\n<<move J-Pe StageRight1>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe Angry>>\nI don't suppose you want to end up like...HIM, do you?\n<<flip J-Pe>>\nYour gaze lingers briefly on the wreath and candles--the only things you have to remember the bed's previous occupant by.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig Neutral>>\nUm...no...?\n<<flip J-Pe>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\nYeah, that's what I thought.\n",
