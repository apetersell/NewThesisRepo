You boys have talent, but you could still brush up your vocals and choreography.\nYou could also spend some time doing a little self-promoting. \nBut most importantly, make sure you're rested for the show.  I don't want you guys running around town all week just to collapse on stage.\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\nOf course.\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\nGot it.\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nAig, did you get all that?\n->Yes!\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    Yup! I'm ready!\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    Good. Now I all want you to schedule your time carefully.\n->So, I can do whatever I want?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    So I can set up my weekly schedule however I want?\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    Yes. It's entirely up to you. But I suggest you plan carefully.\nNow let's get to work.\n<<move J-Pe OffStageRight>><<move Lee OffStageRight>><<move Aig CenterStage>><<move Kent OffStageLeft>>\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\nOh, man...I better plan my week.\n<<move Aig OffStageRight>>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
