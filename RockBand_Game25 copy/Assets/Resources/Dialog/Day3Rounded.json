I didn't hear you come in.\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent NHNF>>\nAig, we need to talk.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NONF>>\nOh, uh...s-sure.\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent NNNF>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\nAig, I don't want to rattle you a week out from your debut, but I just have to be blunt.\n<<expression Kent NHNF>>\nI don't know where you fit in this band.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig ROWF>>\nW-what do you mean.\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent RONF>>\nI mean, marketing has no idea how to package you.\n<<expression Kent NONB>>\nLook, all around you're doing... fine... in your training, but not you're not a standing out in anything.\n<<expression Kent NHNF>>\nYou can move, but you're not really a \"dancer.\"\nYou can sing, but you're not a \"Singer\" with a capital 'S.'\nAnd you've got a little bit of a fan following, but...\n<<expression NONB>>\n...well, you're not J-Pe.\n<<expression NHNF>>\nDo you see what I'm, saying?\n->I'm trying to be well-rounded.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NHNF>>\n    I always thought that I could be the \"well-rounded one.\"\n    <<expression Aig NSNF>>\n    You know, a little bit of this, a little bit of that.  \n    <<expression Aig NONF>>\n    That's a thing...right?\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    <<expression Kent RSNF>>\n    Oh, Aig.\n    Do you know what another word for \"well-rounded\" is?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    You mean, like, jack of all-\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    <<expression Kent NNNF>>\n    Boring.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig RONF>>\n    Boring?\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    <<expression Kent RNNF>>\n    Boring.\n    <<expression Kent NHNF>>\n    <<expression Aig NNNF>>\n    Trust me, nobody has ever succeeded in this business by being \"the well-rounded one.\"\n    <<expression Kent NHNB>>\n    Survived, maybe, but certainly not succeeded.\n    <<expression Kent NNNF>>\n    And I get it, it's important to have SOME skills across the board. You don't want to be the one slowing down the band when it's go time.\n    <<expression Kent RHNF>>\n    But you don't want to be...boring.  You get me?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NONF>>\n    I... think so?\n->I think so.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NONB>>\n    I... guess so.\n    <<expression Aig NNNF>>\n    You're saying I'm not good at anything?\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    <<expression Kent RSNF>>\n    Exactly!\n",
