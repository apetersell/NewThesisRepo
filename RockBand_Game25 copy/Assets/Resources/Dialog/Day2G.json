What's up?\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nTo be quite blunt, Aig, I'm not sure where you fit in this band.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig Angry>>\nWhat do you mean?\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nHow do I put this.\nWhen a fan looks at a Boy Band, they like to see strong, indetifiable personalities that are easy to connect with.\nFor instance, Jaypee is an unpredictable but charasmatic hearthrob with a bit of a wild side.\nAnd Lee is the strong, sensitive leader who truly cares about the music.\nBoom. Those right there are two big personalities that are easy to pick out of a line up.\nBut when I look at you, I don't see anything in particular. \nTo me, you're just...I don't know.  Some guy.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\nJust...some guy?\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nExactly! You're...how do I put this...\nYou're handsome, but you're not gorgeous. \nYou're talented, but you're not a prodigy.\nYou're funny, but you're not hilarious.\nYou're nice, but you're not Ghandi.\nDo you see what I'm saying?\n->Yeah.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    Yeah...I think so.\n->Am I cute?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig Happy>>\n    Well..am I cute?\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    Uh...\n    Well, yeah...\n    But you're not adorable.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig Angry>>\n    Oh...\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nLook, Aig, you were able to coast through the Academy on you're mediocrity, but your career will die in the cradle if you don't start carving out a niche for yourself.\nI want you to really focus on making yourself stand out.\nIf you want to succeed in this industry, you can't get away with being just a person any more. You have to be a personALITY. You get me?\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig Neutral>>\nY-yeah. I get you.\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nGood! \n<<flip Kent>>\nNow get back to work.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\nYes, ma'am!\n<<move Kent OffStageLeft>><<move Aig CenterStage>>\n...\n<<expression Aig Angry>>\n...Jesus.",
