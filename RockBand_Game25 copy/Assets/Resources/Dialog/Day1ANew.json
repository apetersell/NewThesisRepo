What's up?\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\n<<expression Lee NNNF>>\nI like you, Aigburth.\nIn general, I think the things you do are very baller.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig RLWF>>\nAw, thanks Lee!\n<<expression Aig NSNF>>\nI think you're...baller...too!\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\n<<expression Lee NHNF>>\nDope.\n<<expression Lee NNNF>>\nWe should coordinate our schedules more often.\nI take it you already know how to coordinate your schedule with your bandmates?\n-> No, teach me how!\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig ROWF>>\n    Wait, we can coordinate our schedules?\n    <<name Friendship Lee>>\n    Certainly.\n    <<start Tutorial>>\n    Have you ever noticed the little hexagonal nodes next to the timeslots on your schedule?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NNNF>>\n    Oh yeah.  I was wondering what those were about.\n    <<name Friendship Lee>>\n    Those tell you what activities J-Pe and I will be doing during the week.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    The 'J' nodes represent J-Pe...\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    ...and the 'L' nodes represent myself.\n    <<expression Lee NNNB>>\n    Obviously.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    <<expression Aig NNNF>>\n    The color of the node will tell you what activity we'll be doing at that the time.\n    For example, an orange 'L' node next to a timeslot means that I will be at Dance Practice at that time during the week.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    So if you wanted to hang out with me, you'd just schedule Dance Practice in the same timeslot. \n    Then, during the week, you would see me at the dance studio with you.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    Coordinating your schedule can be a powerful tool.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    You'll get more out of your training if you practice with people you like.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    Though, on the other hand, practicing with people who hate you can be a nightmare.\n    <<expression Lee NONF>>\n    <<end Tutorial>>\n    Make sense?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NOSF>>\n    I think so. It's just...\n    <<name Friendship Lee>>\n    Hm?\n-> Yup! I got it.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig RLNF>>\n    For sure! It's those little nodes next to the timeslots on my schedule, right?\n    <<name Friendship Lee>>\n    <<expression Lee NHNF>>\n    Precisely.\n    <<expression Lee NNNF>>\n    Keep in mind that training with people who like you can be a huge boon to your professional development.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NONF>>\nHow...do I know if someone likes me?\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\n<<expression Lee RNSF>>\n...hm.\n<<expression Lee NNNF>>\nWhat a fascinating question.\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<expression Lee RNSF>>\n...\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<expression Lee RHSF>>\nLet's test it, shall we?\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<expression Lee AOWF>>\nHEY! J-PE!\n<<expression J-Pe ANSF>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<flip J-Pe>>\nWHAT!\n<<move J-Pe CenterStage>>\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<expression Lee NNNF>>\nThis better be good! \nI was chatting it up with what was probably a very attractive probably girl on what was probably social media.\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\nJ-Pe, you know that purple suede jacket you had?\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe ANSF>>\nYou mean the one that I LOVED that was RUINED when it was mysteriously COVERED in petroleum jelly.\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\nYes, that one.\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\nWhat about it?\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\nAig is the one who covered it in petroleum jelly.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig ROWF>>\nWhat?!\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe AOSF>>\nWHAT?!\n<<flip J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe ANSF>>\nAig! What the fricken' frick! Why would you do that!?\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\n<<expression Lee NONF>>\nNow be careful what you say, Aigburth. Your friendship with J-Pe hangs in the balance.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NOWF>>\nBut I didn't-!\n<<expression Aig NONF>>\nUhh...\n-> It was an accident!\n    <<expression Aig NONF>>\n    It was, uh...an accident?\n    <<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n    <<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\n    Oh, it was an accident?\n    ...\n    ...\n    ...\n    <<expression J-Pe AOSF>>\n    <<statDown Friendship J-Pe>>\n    WHAT KIND OF LAME EXCUSE IS THAT?!\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NNNB>>\n    Uhhh...\n    <<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n    <<expression J-Pe ANSF>>\n    Nobody \"accidentally\" spills an entire tub of petroleum jelly on an innocent jacket!\n    It was smeared! Intentionally, god damn it!\n    You MURDERED my suede jacket.\n    <<flip J-Pe>>\n    <<expression J-Pe ANSB>>\n    *ugh*\n    <<flip J-Pe>>\n    I quit the band.  Don't talk to me ever again.\n    <<expression J-Pe ANSF>>\n    <<flip J-Pe>>\n    <<move J-Pe OffStageRight>>\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig ROWF>>\n    ...\n    But I-\n    <<name Friendship Lee>>\n    <<expression Lee NNWF>>\n    You see, he hates you now.\n    <<expression Lee NNNF>>\n    I'd probably avoid him in practice until he comes around.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NONF>>\n    But how do I make him like me again?\n    <<name Friendship Lee>>\n    Just make sure you say the right things when you talk to him.\n    Get to know him.  Maybe next time you won't mess up so profoundly.\n-> I was jealous of you.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    I guess I did it because...I was jealous?\n    Of...you?\n    <<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n    JEALOUS?!\n    ...\n    ...\n    ...\n    <<expression J-Pe RSNF>>\n    <<statUp Friendship J-Pe>>\n    Oh, Aiggy. You're so adorable.\n    I always knew you looked up to me, but this is just way too cute.\n    <<expression Aig NSNB>>\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    Uh...right! Yeah! Exactly!\n    <<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n    <<expression Aig NNNF>>\n    <<expression J-Pe AHNF>>\n    Listen, Aiggy, it's okay to be blown away by me.\n    <<flip J-Pe>>\n    <<expression J-Pe AHNB>>\n    Trust me, I blow myself away on a daily basis.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NONF>>\n    You...blow...yourself-\n    <<flip J-Pe>>\n    <<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n    <<move J-Pe StageLeft1>>\n    <<expression J-Pe AHNF>>\n    <<expression Aig RNWF>>\n    -away, yes.\n    And, I know it's hard not to get caught up in my storm.\n    <<move J-Pe CenterStage>>\n    <<expression J-Pe NSNF>>\n    Just, next time, leave the jacket out of it, m'kay?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NNNB>>\n    Uh, yeah. Sure. I'm sorry.\n    <<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n    <<expression Aig NNNF>>\n    Water under the bridge, Aiggy!\n    <<flip J-Pe>>\n    Now if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have to get back to being probably not catfished by a probably not forty year old dude.\n    <<flip J-Pe>>\n    <<expression J-Pe RHNF>>\n    Tootles!\n    <<flip J-Pe>>\n    <<move J-Pe OffStageRight>>\n    <<name Friendship Lee>>\n    Good work, Aigburth.  He likes you.\n    You said the right thing by stroking his ego, and now he too thinks you are baller.\n    You'll probably benefit from practicing with him now.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NONF>>\n    That's all I have to do? Say the right things when I talk to people?\n    <<name Friendship Lee>>\n    Pretty much, though it's rarely as easy as it sounds.\n    Trust me.\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\n<<expression Lee NNNF>>\nAt any rate, I've got to go.\nI have places...and animals to be.\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<expression Lee NNNB>>\nDon't wait up.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig RNWF>>\n<<expression Lee RNNF>>\nWait! Lee!\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<expression Lee RNNF>>\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\nYes?\n-> Thanks for your help.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig RLNF>>\n    Thanks for helping me out. You're a good guy.\n    <<name Friendship Lee>>\n    <<expression Lee NNNB>>\n    *ahem*\n    <<statUp Friendship Lee>>\n    <<expression Lee NHNF>>\n    Don't mention it.  Like I said, I think the things you do are very baller, and I'd like to continue hanging out.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    Yeah, any time!\n    <<name Friendship Lee>>\n    <<flip Lee>>\n    <<expression Aig NNNB>>\n    I'll see you later, Aigburth.\n    <<expression Aig NNNF>>\n    <<move Lee OffStageRight>>\n    <<move Aig CenterStage>>\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NSNF>>\n    Man.\n    <<expression Aig Neutral>>\n    <<expression Aig NNNF>>\n    That guy sure says \"baller\" a lot.\n-> You ruined J-Pe's jacket, didn't you?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig RONF>>\n    It was you who put the petroleum jelly on J-Pe's jacket, right?\n    <<name Friendship Lee>>\n    ...\n    <<statDown Friendship Lee>>\n    <<expression Lee ANSF>>\n    No.\n    <<flip Lee>>\n    I'll see you later, Aigburth.\n    <<move Lee OffStageRight>>\n    <<move Aig CenterStage>>\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NNNF>>\n    Man.\n    <<expression Aig RNNB>>\n    What a weird dude.\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n\n    \n",
