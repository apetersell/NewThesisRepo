Sorry.\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\n<<expression J-Pe NSNF>>\n<<flip J-Pe>>\n<<move J-Pe CenterStage>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\nWhat about you, big guy? You don't seem that excited about graduating.\nI thought you of all people would be happy to get out of that stupid \"Boy Band Academy.\" \n<<name Friendship Lee>>\nThe academy...NOT the academy...it makes no difference to me.\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<expression Lee NOSF>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\nThat thing which we call the world is nothing but a figment; a bubble of our own making, poised to burst at even the slightest provocation.\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<expression Lee ANSF>>\nAnd we are powerless to stop it.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NNNB>>\n...\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNNB>>\n...\n<<expression Lee NNNF>>\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\n...\n<<expression J-Pe NLNF>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<flip J-Pe>>\nThis guy, amirite?\n<<flip J-Pe>>\nClassic, Lee.\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\n<<expression Lee ANSB>>\nHmph.\n<<expression J-Pe NNNB>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<flip J-Pe>>\nAaaaanyway.\n<<expression J-Pe NSNF>>\n<<expression Lee NNNF>>\nThe important thing is that we're FINALLY a real band!\n<<name Friendship ...>>\nNot yet you're not.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig RLWF>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\nMiss Kent!\n<<move Aig StageRight2>>\n<<flip J-Pe>>\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<flip Kent>>\n<<move J-Pe StageRight1>>\n<<move Lee CenterStage>>\n<<move Kent StageLeft2>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe NHNF>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\nAh, come to congratulate us, Miss Kent?\nOr should we just call you \"Kim\" from now on? Seeing as we're pretty much equals now.\n<<expression J-Pe RLNF>>\nWhat'dya think, Kimmy?\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent AHSF>>\n\"Miss Kent\" will be just fine, J-Pe.\n<<expression Kent NNNF>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\nI may not be your teacher anymore, but I AM your manager.\n<<expression Kent NNNB>>\nAt least I will be when you're an actual a band.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig ROWF>>\nYou mean...we're not a band?\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent NNNF>>\nThe company won't officially sign you onto the label until you've proven yourselves as talents.\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe ANNF>>\nAnd graduating the academy doesn't count as \"proving ourselves?\"\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nNo.\n<<expression Kent NNWF>>\nIt only means that your are READY to prove yourselves.\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNSB>>\nWhat? Lame.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NOWF>>\nSo how do we \"prove ourselves?\"\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\nYou'll perform in a debut concert coming at the end of the month. Do well and you'll be signed to the PYRO as a REAL boy band.\nDo poorly, and they'll drop you so fast your head will spin.\n<<expression Kent ANSF>>\nNo going back to the academy, no second chances.\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\n<<expression Lee RNNF>>\nHmph.\n<<expression J-Pe RHSF>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\nHeh. Do or die? I love it.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NNWF>>\n*gulp*\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent NNNF>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\n<<expression Lee NNNF>>\nI've already taken care of most of the planning.  The venue is booked, promotion is good, and tickets are selling.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NONF>>\nSo what should we do?\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent RNWF>>\nWhatever you want.\n<<expression Kent NNNF>>\nYou're big boys now. From now on I leave it up to you to determine your own schedules.\nYou can spend your time however you'd like.\n<<expression Kent RNWF>>\nYou boys can handle that, right?\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\nSure.\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe RLWF>>\nUGH! Finally! Freedom!\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nAig, do you know how to set up your own schedule?\n->No, can you teach me?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NONF>>\n    <<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\n    I, uh...no. Can you teach me?\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    <<expression Kent NNWU>>\n    *sigh* Fine.\n    <<expression Kent NNNF>>\n    <<expression Aig NNNF>>\n    You'll be presented with an empty schedule at the beginning of each week.\n    Each schedule is broken up into seven days, and each day is broken up into day and night.\n    So you'll have fourteen timeslots to schedule each week.\n    To make your schedule, all you have to do is choose what activity you want to do, and drag it into whichever timeslot you like.\n    You'll then carry out your activities in the order that you scheduled them.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NLNF>>\n    Cool!\n    <<expression Aig NONF>>\n    Uh...what activities can I do?\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    <<expression Kent RNNF>>\n    <<expression Aig NNNF>>\n    For now, just stick to your training.\n    <<expression Kent NNNF>>\n    The academy dance studio is open if you want to brush up on your choreography.\n    And the sound booth is available when you want to work on your vocal training.\n    You can also start establishing your personal brand by getting out there and promoting yourself.\n    Doing well in these activities will make you a better performer, and you'll be more likely to succeed at the concert.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NLNF>>\n    Got it! I'm going to practice my butt off!\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    <<expression Kent NSNF>>\n    Good.\n    It might take you a while to get a feel for it, but I'm sure you'll be scheduling like a pro in no time.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    Ha ha! Thanks!\n->Yup! Got it!\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NLNF>>\n    Yup! Totally got it!\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    <<expression Kent NSNF>>\n    Excellent.\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent ANNF>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\nNow let's get to work.\nRemember, the debut concert is in one month, and I need you guys in top form.\nGot it?\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\nSure.\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe NHNF>>\nNo sweat.\n<<expression Aig NLNF>>\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\nYup!

XIX.\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe RONF>>\nXIX?\n<<expression J-Pe ANSF>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\nUh, how do you pronounce that?\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent NNWU>>\nHow should I know? \n<<expression Kent NNNF>>\nMarketing says it'll look good on billboards or something.\nDon't think about it too much. It's not important.\n<<flip Kent>>\nNow get to work.\n<<move Kent OffStageLeft>>\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<move Lee StageLeft2>>\n<<flip J-Pe>>\n<<move J-Pe CenterStage>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\nXIX, huh?\nIs it like...\"zicks?\"\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\n\"Shish.\"\n<<flip J-Pe>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe AONF>>\nOr \"zizz?\"\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\n\"Zish.\"\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe RONF>>\nOr maybe it's like, literally \"X-I-X?\" Like an abbreviation?\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\n<<expression Lee RONB>>\n\"Xi-uh...\n<<expression Lee RONF>>\nX-Xixzzle Sticks.\"\n<<flip J-Pe>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe ANWU>>\nWHATEVER!\n<<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\n<<expression Lee NNNF>>\nKent's right, it's not important.\n<<expression J-Pe AHNF>>\nWhat is important is that we don't fuck up this debut concert.\n<<expression J-Pe ALNF>>\nSo let's move boys!\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<move J-Pe OffStageRight>>\n<<move Lee OffStageLeft>>\n<<move Aig CenterStage>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\nXIX, huh?\n<<expression Aig RSWF>>\nThis should be fun!\nRight?\n<<expression Aig RONF>>\n...right?\n<<expression Aig RNNB>>\n...\n<<flip Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NONF>>\nI better get to work!\n<<move Aig OffStageRight>>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
