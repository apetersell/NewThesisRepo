I'm sweating!  I can't stop sweating!\n<<expression Aig NONF>>\nWow... I'm REALLY sweating?\n<<flip Aig>>\nShould I be sweating this much?\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe RHNF>>\nJesus, calm down Aiggy.  You're dripping all over the place!\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NLNF>>\nHa ha! Sorry!\n<<expression J-Pe RLNF>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\nHa ha!\n<<expression J-Pe NSNF>>\n...\n<<expression J-Pe ANSF>>\nBut seriously though, get away from me. You're dripping all over my new shoes.\n<<expression Aig RONB>>\n<<move Aig StageRight2>>\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\nRight! Sorry.\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\n<<expression J-Pe NSNF>>\n<<flip J-Pe>>\n<<move J-Pe CenterStage>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\nWhat about you, big guy? You don't seem that excited about graduating.\nI thought you of all people would be happy to get out of that stupid \"Boy Band Academy.\" \n<<name Friendship Lee>>\nThe academy...NOT the academy...it makes no difference to me.\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<expression Lee NOSF>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\nThat thing which we call the world is nothing but a figment; a bubble of our own making, poised to burst at even the slightest provocation.\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<expression Lee ANSF>>\nAnd we are powerless to stop it.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NNNB>>\n...\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNNB>>\n...\n<<expression Lee NNNF>>\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\n...\n<<expression J-Pe NLNF>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<flip J-Pe>>\nThis guy, amirite?\n<<flip J-Pe>>\nClassic, Lee.\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\n<<expression Lee ANSB>>\nHmph.\n<<expression J-Pe NNNB>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<flip J-Pe>>\nAaaaanyway.\n<<expression J-Pe NSNF>>\n<<expression Lee NNNF>>\nThe important thing is that we're FINALLY a real band!\n<<name Friendship ...>>\nNot yet you're not.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig RLWF>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\nMiss Kent!\n<<move Aig StageRight2>>\n<<flip J-Pe>>\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<flip Kent>>\n<<move J-Pe StageRight1>>\n<<move Lee CenterStage>>\n<<move Kent StageLeft2>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe NHNF>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\nAh, come to congratulate us, Miss Kent?\nOr should we just call you \"Kim\" from now on? Seeing as we're pretty much equals now.\n<<expression J-Pe RLNF>>\nWhat'dya think, Kimmy?\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent AHSF>>\n\"Miss Kent\" will be just fine, J-Pe.\n<<expression Kent NNNF>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\nI may not be your teacher anymore, but I AM your manager.\n<<expression Kent NNNB>>\nAt least I will be when you're an actual a band.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig ROWF>>\nYou mean...we're not a band?\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent NNNF>>\nThe company won't officially sign you onto the label until you've proven yourselves as talents.\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe ANNF>>\nAnd graduating the academy doesn't count as \"proving ourselves?\"\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nNo.\n<<expression Kent NNWF>>\nIt only means that your are READY to prove yourselves.\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNSB>>\nWhat? Lame.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NOWF>>\nSo how do we \"prove ourselves?\"\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\nYou'll perform in a debut concert coming at the end of the month. \nIf you're able to score enough fans at the gig, you'll be signed onto the PYRO label a REAL boy band.\nIf not, they'll drop you so fast your head will spin.\n<<expression Kent ANSF>>\nNo going back to the academy, no second chances.\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\n<<expression Lee RNNF>>\nHmph.\n<<expression J-Pe RHSF>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\nHeh. Do or die? I love it.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NNWF>>\n*gulp*\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent NNNF>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\n<<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\n<<expression Lee NNNF>>\nI've already taken care of most of the planning.  The venue is booked, promotion is good, and tickets are selling.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NONF>>\nSo what should we do?\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent RNWF>>\nWhatever you want.\n<<expression Kent NNNF>>\nYou're big boys now. From now on I leave it up to you to determine your own schedules.\n<<expression Kent RNWF>>\nYou boys can handle that, right?\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\nSure.\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe RLWF>>\nUGH! Finally! Freedom!\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\nAig, do you know how to set up your own schedule?\n->No, can you teach me?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NONF>>\n    <<expression J-Pe NNNF>>\n    I, uh...no. Can you teach me?\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    <<expression Kent NNWU>>\n    *sigh* Looks like I'll never stop being your teacher.\n    <<expression Kent NNNF>>\n    Alright, listen up.\n    <<expression Aig NNNF>>\n    <<start Tutorial>>\n    You'll get an empty schedule at the beginning of each week.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    It's broken up into seven days...\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    ...and each day is broken up into day and night.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    So you have fourteen timeslots to schedule each week.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    To fill out your schedule, first select an activity by clicking its icon beneath your schedule.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    Then, click inside one of your schedule slots to fill it in with the selected activity.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    You can also hold down the mouse button and drag your cursor across multiple slots to fill them all in at once.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    You can fill out your schedule however you'd like.\n    You don't need to fill it in any particular order, or with any particular activities.\n    As long as it's full, you're good to go.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    When you're happy with you're schedule, click the 'Ready' button.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    During the week, you'll perform each activity in your schedule in chronological order.\n    How much time you spend doing each activity is determined by how many consecutive slots you scheduled that activity for.\n    So if you want to do one activity for a nice chunk of time, fill a bunch of slots in a row with that activity.\n    On the other hand, if you only want to spend a little bit of time on an activity, put it in a slot all by itself.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    If you do well during practice, you'll become a better performer.\n    <<next Tutorial>>\n    Which means you'll score more fans at the debut.\n    And you'll be one step closer to being a REAL band.\n    <<end Tutorial>>\n    Did you get all that, Aig?\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig RNWB>>\n    It sounds...complicated.\n    <<expression Aig NNNF>>\n    <<expression Kent NSNF>>\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    Don't worry. It's pretty easy once you get the hang of it.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    Where should I start?\n->Yup! Got it!\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig NLNF>>\n    Yup! Totally got it!\n    <<name Friendship Kent>>\n    <<expression Kent NSNF>>\n    Good boy.\n    <<name Friendship Aig>>\n    <<expression Aig RLWF>>\n    Aw man! So many possiblities! I don't even know where to start!\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent RNNF>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\nFor now, just stick to your training.\n<<expression Kent NNNF>>\n<<unlock Unlocks Dance>>\nThe academy dance studio is open if you want to brush up on your choreography.\n<<unlock Unlocks Vocal>>\nAnd the sound booth is available when you want to work on your vocal training.\n<<unlock Unlocks PR>>\nYou can also start establishing your personal brand by getting out there and promoting yourself.\n<<vanish Unlocks>>\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent ANNF>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\nNow let's get to work.\nRemember, the debut concert is in one month, and I need you guys in top form.\nGot it?\n<<name Friendship Lee>>\nSure.\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe NHNF>>\nNo sweat.\n<<expression Aig NLNF>>\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\nYup! We got this.\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<flip Kent>>\n<<expression Kent NNNF>>\nGood. Now get moving, people.\n<<move Kent OffStageLeft>>\n<<name Friendship J-Pe>>\n<<expression J-Pe ALNF>>\nYou heard the lady. Let's boogie, boys!\n<<flip Lee>>\n<<move J-Pe OffStageRight>>\n<<move Lee OffStageLeft>>\n<<move Aig CenterStage>>\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig RSWF>>\nThis should be fun!\nRight, guys?\n<<expression Aig RONF>>\n...guys?\n<<expression Aig RNNB>>\n...\n<<flip Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NONF>>\nI better get to work!\n<<move Aig OffStageRight>>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
