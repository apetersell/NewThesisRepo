Why?\n<<flip Kent>>\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Kent NHNF>>\n*sigh*\n<<flip Kent>>\n<<expression Kent AHNF>>\nBecause I'm afraid you're turning into a little Wendy Katz.\n<<expression Kent AHNB>>\nThere's already plenty of...THAT...to go around.\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Kent AHNF>>\nBut...\nI like Miss Katz.\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression Aig ANNF>>\nWendy never graduated out of Girl Group Academy, and now she's stuck choreographing for PYRO just to pay off her tuition debts, you know why?\n<<name Friendship Aig>>\n<<expression Aig NNNF>>\nN-no.\n<<name Friendship Kent>>\n<<expression ANSF>>\nBecause nobody likes the bubbly go-getter type.\n<<flip Kent>>\n<<expression Kent ANNF>>\nSure, it's cute at first, but it doesn't last.
